Tasks for today: 
- See how the navbar and the sidebar are implemented and try to model them 
  in smart store
- Start working on the dashboard 


General Notes 
- For auth checking we can use RequireAuth.tsx component 
- For notifications we can use the one inside the LayoutComponent.tsx

Task Planning (Navbar and Sidebar)
- We will create a LayoutComponent inside the components folder and we will call the Layout component inside it 
  then we will call LayoutComponent inside the main layout.tsx 
- The i18 provider will not be inside the main layout.tsx because inside this we will not use "use client" directive
